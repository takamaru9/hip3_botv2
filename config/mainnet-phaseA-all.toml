# HIP-3 Bot Configuration - Phase A All XYZ Markets
# Purpose: Collect signal data from ALL xyz markets for optimization analysis
# Mode: Observation (no trading, signal detection and recording only)
#
# How it works:
#   - mode = "observation" allows auto-discovery of all xyz markets
#   - [[markets]] section is omitted -> all xyz markets are automatically subscribed
#   - Signals are detected and saved to Parquet files for analysis
#   - No orders are placed, no execution happens
