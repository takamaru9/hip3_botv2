# HIP-3 Bot Configuration - Trading Mode (Parallel Execution)
# Purpose: Test Position Tracker Sync fix with live trading
# Runs alongside Observation container for comparison
#
# Key features being tested:
# - Post response fill -> Position update (P0)
# - cloid-based fill deduplication (P0)
# - Periodic position resync (P1, 60s interval)

# Trading markets: Data-driven optimization (2026-01-31)
#
# Analysis (17.5 hours of data with 30 bps threshold):
#   - Overall WR: 28.3%, Net PnL: -$27.40
#   - SILVER: 898 trades, WR 31.6% (best performer but still losing)
#   - INTC/COIN/HOOD/MSTR: Too few trades, all losing
#
# Duration analysis (SILVER):
#   - ≤5s:   WR 62.5%, +6.43 bps  ← Sweet spot!
#   - 5-15s: WR 36.8%, -1.58 bps
#   - >15s:  WR 28.5%, -8.35 bps  ← TimeStop kills profits
#
# Strategy: Focus on SILVER only, faster exit
